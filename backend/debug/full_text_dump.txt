Course Description This is a first course on computer networks.The course will introduce the fundamentals of computer
networking and a number of protocols. The course introduces the layered protocol architecture
concept and discusses physical, data link, network, transport and application layers. It describes the
functionalities of these layers as well as the main protocols pertaining to these layers. The course
emphasizes the architecture and protocols used in the Internet. It also introduces wireless networks,
cloud computing, Internet of Things, network security and software defined networking. The
programming component will be covered in a companion laboratory course
Course Objectives Knowledge of how computer networks are designed and operated
Knowledge of the architecture of the Internet and its protocols
Learning Outcomes After studying this course, the students will be able to
understand the design issues of computer networks and appreciate layered architecture and
protocol design
use appropriate tools for designing and implementing networked systems
design network applications
